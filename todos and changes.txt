- [x] rewrite checking of skill tree validity function to ensure that all nodes that have zero pre-reqs are either activated or available by default, rather than what is currently the case which is to ensure that simply at least 1 node of a component cluster of nodes is available/activated. this is to prevent skill trees from being create that have nodes that are impossible to activate

- [ ] experiment with adding animated alpha masks using an alpha texture and CSS transitions to make the edges

- [ ] fix bug where double-clicking an icon node, waiting a second, and then single clicking the same node does not change buttons back to state selection buttons
- [x] fix bug where initial node creation does not correctly initialize flourishes of hidden nodes as hidden

- [x] fix bug where edges are selectable in player mode which makes the delete button show (but it shouldn't)

- [x] implement multiple prereq nodes, such that, for nodes A and B that both point to node C, that node C will not become available until both nodes A and B are activated

- [ ] feat font toggle that allows switching between Old English Text MT and other choices that are easier to read

- [x] feat more descriptive error message for when skill tree is in an invalid format for switching from builder mode into player mode, such as "Invalid skill tree state: Please make that, of the following nodes, there is at least one node that is available or activated."

- [x] feat check to prevent invalid root node states (i.e. root nodes must not have an initial state of 'hidden') so as to prevent skill trees from becoming "locked out" and unable to "complete" their skill tree

  - [ ] feat show more info about a node upon single click in player mode
  - [ ] hide display or show ??? display instead of actual node information when in player mode and the currently selected node is hidden
  - [ ] brainstorm how else to show info, where it might be annoying to have a single click bring up the info modal/panel, and what alternatives could there be instead? (button, toggle, etc.)... one idea is to summon a button in the bottom right corner of the window which is the "open info panel/modal" button when only a single node is selected

- [x] feat hidden nodes showing with "hidden" icon, no text label, and no flourish

- [x] add confirmation step to 'Clear Skill Tree' action so as to prevent accidental skill tree deletions

- [x] implement ability to select icon for a given node from a list of icons
  - [x] add change icon btn upon double click of a node
  - [x] add sidebar with visual icon list displayed

- [x] feat detection of cycles upon switching into player mode
  - [x] disallow cycles in skill trees

- [ ] replace all alerts with an alert modal in the current style
- [ ] replace all yes/no prompts with a yes/no prompt modal in the current style

- [x] fix prevent single click of flourish nodes from triggering the info modal popup

- [ ] feat custom background images behind the skill tree

- [ ] brainstorm options for activating/summoning the info modal for a given node, would you prefer single click, long press, double click, or something else entirely? would you prefer to click to make another button, or directly open up the info modal itself on the designated gesture? keep in mind that single click and double-click can be differented with a timer, and 375ms is an acceptable threshold for differentiating

- [x] make sure that when loading a skill tree it conforms correctly to the mode that the user of the app is currently in, regardless of whatever mode the skill tree was saved in

- [ ] prevent entering of player mode when there is no skill tree ( not sure yet if this is ideal or not, will think on it some more...)

- [ ] update rm edge selection in player mode

- [ ] add celebration modal/popup/thingie when the skill tree is fully activated in player mode

- ~~fix bug where refreshing page while in player mode messes up node state (this appears to not be reproducable anymore, it may have been fixed already)~~

- [ ] fix bug where refreshing page resets the zoom back to full view of the skill tree

- [x] fix async font loading issue so that the correct font is loaded consistently before the graph loads

- [ ] decide how to handle selection of 1 node and 1 edge: should the buttons for the node show, for the edge show, neither, or both?

- [x] feat newly created nodes in builder mode are set to hidden by default
- [x] feat toggling of nodes in builder mode between 'activated', 'available', and 'hidden'
- [x] feat locking of nodes in place upon switching to player mode
- [ ] feat optional locking of nodes in place in builder mode w/ lock icon buttons

- [x] fix connect node button so that it appears centered vertically as well as horizontally between the two nodes that it is to connect

- [x] fix bug where loading a tree saved in player mode directly into builder mode does not reset state and tempState for all nodes: this can be resolved by toggling the state and tempState for all nodes prior to saving and/or by checking upon loading, as well as by saving what mode the skill tree was saved in (though I'd prefer to simply always save in builder mode)

- [x] modify text input so that it is located where the node text is

- [ ] fix button popups so that they always appear visually on the canvas, so, in other words, if the selected node to edit is at the top of the screen, the buttons will appear below it. if the selected node is at the right-most edge of the canvas, then the buttons will be offset to the left so that they are both visible

- [x] prevent flashing edge bug from occurring when canvas is fullscreen height and width

- [x] fix bug where three nodes are selected, and 1 is unselected and the connect button should reappear but currently doesn't

- [ ] make the edit modal more beautiful

- [x] prevent the connect button from appearing when selecting two nodes that are already connected

- [x] make popup buttons move with parent node when dragging a selected node

- [x] fix bug where deleting a node does not yet unregister the node as "selected", which causes an error that, upon deleting a node and then immediately selecting another node triggers the following error: 
"""
useGraphHandlers.js:51 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')
    at useGraphHandlers.js:51:26
    at Element2.<anonymous> 
"""
the suggested fix is to, upon deleting a node, clear the selected nodes list
